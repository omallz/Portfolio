# Assignment-1 and Assignment-2

## Summary

The aim for Assignment-2 is specifically "build a professional portfolio site using HTML and CSS following a set of specifications and a style guide". Assignment-2 is a branch off of the original Assignment 1 repository which leverages Bootstrap 4 to be Mobile responsive.

## How This Was Achieved

We are hosting the code on a GitHub repository. A branch was created for Assignment-2 off of Assignment-1 which was due to be marked at the time of this documentation (06/11/2019).

## Challenges Faced

Choosing which of the HTML 5 elements to use instead of div was interesting. I went with using regular divs in the end as it's what I'm comfortable with.

Creating a branch and pushing it remotely required a minor amount of my own time but it made sense pretty quickly.
