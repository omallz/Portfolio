# Assignment-1

## Summary

The aim for this assignment is specifically "build a professional portfolio site using HTML and CSS following a set of specifications and a style guide".

## How This Was Achieved

We are hosting the code on a GitHub repository

## Challenges Faced

Choosing which of the HTML 5 elements to use instead of div was interesting. I went with using regular divs in the end as it's what I'm comfortable with.

I only found out that I could do my own layout after I had completed mine so I would have redone the entire display in Flexbox if I had known. This made the Portfolio page particularly annoying.

## Final Thoughts

It was definitely disheartening to hear that I could have written the code my way and not as per the examples, but I will seek more clarification in future.
